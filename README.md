The project is a demo code for the course 8730 - Natural Language Processing and Understanding of University of Windsor. 
The system takes English statements as an input and draw a conclusion based on that. 
The system is currently limited to only a certain subset of English statement and use only one rule of inference. 

To use this program, you can directly double click on the `bat ` file if you're using the Windows OS. 
You can also manually run the script by typing following commands. 

`pip install -r requirements.txt` 
This will install the required libraries for the script to run.

`python main.py`
